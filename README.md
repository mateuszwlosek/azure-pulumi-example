# Azure + Azure Dev Ops Pipelines + Pulumi Example

Example of [Azure AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) (in python) usage.  
Docker images stored in [Azure container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/).  
Used pipelines in [Azure Dev Ops](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).  

Used [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts for [mongoDB](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) and [NGINX Ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress).  
Includes also a simple [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application.  

## Spring Boot application
Created a very simple spring boot application to show rolling updates with Azure pipelines/Kubernetes and ingress usage.    
Contains three endpoints:  
* `GET /` - returns String "TEST" (Can be simply changed and when changes are pushed, the image should be updated and a new value should be returned)  
* `GET /user/` - returns list of Users in the MongoDB database  
* `POST /user?username=(username)` - creates a user with the given username  

MongoDB properties in `application.properties` are configured to use environment variables that are configured in a pipeline.  

## Pulumi
Created two Pulumi projects, which create the following resources:  
  
basic:
 - namespace
 - NGINX Ingress resources (defined in Helm) 
 - storage class
 - persistent volume claim (for MongoDB)
 - MongoDB resources (defined in helm)  
 
demo-app:
 - simple spring boot application deployment
 - service for the application
 - ingress for the application

Projects contain a lot of environment variables usage, so they can be easily configured in Azure Pipelines.  
Used v2 of Helm package as v3 has problems with Helm hooks:  
https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-kubernetes/issues/555

## Pipelines

**Pulumi pipeline**:  
Pipelines that executes `pulumi up`. Used for both Pulumi projects (environment variables differ).  
I used Pulumi task and Pulumi script in a console. Pulumi script was used to create a new stack if it doesn't exist. I couldn't do that in task as the Pulumi task assumes that the stack already exists. I used a Pulumi task for `pulumi up` as Pulumi in a script has problems with environment variables. Because of that, I needed to use two different env variables that Pulumi needs for authentication (`PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `pulumi.access.token`. One is used by Pulumi task the other one is used by `pulumi login`).  
Used AzureCLI task to log in as `azureSubscription` parameter did not work with Pulumi task.  
  
`env` had to be defined for a script to use a secret env variable:  
```
  env:
    PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: $(PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN)
```
  
`|| true` was used in `pulumi stack init` script to ignore errors.  
I did not use `continueOnError` as it displays a warning even that pipeline should be considered fully successful.

**Docker build push rolling update pipeline**:  
Pipeline builds a Docker image, pushes it to Docker repository, creates image secret, and performs rolling update to update current deployment with new image (using secret created in previous step).  
Pipeline is executed on any change in the repository. Thanks to that, any changes in the spring boot application are deployed instantly when the code on the master branch changes.

[Install Pulumi (Optional)](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)  


### Setup Kubernetes cluster
Go to `Kubernetes services` and add a new Kubernetes cluster.  
While creating the cluster, add a new resource group while clicking `Create new`.  
Go to the `Integrations` tab and create a new container registry with `Create new`.  
If you are using a free trial account, change `node count` to 1.  
All the other settings can be left as the default ones.

| pulumi.access.token        | Same token as in `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Two env variables are needed)                                                                                          | pul-8e8kcaj95h86g10dec4dx1f7w18s20fb2ga66894      |
| pulumi_directory           | Directory with pulumi files. Any value                                                                                                                                  | pulumi/demo-app/                          |
| pulumi_stack               | Pulumi stack name. Any value                                                                                                                                               | demo-stack                                |
| resources_group_name       | Resources group name. Generated when Kubernetes cluster was created                                                                                                                   | test-resource-group                       |

Save changes and run the pipeline.  
Rename the pipeline to: `Pulumi demo app up`  

You can check the environment now in Azure webpage or in CLI.  

**When anything is changed in the repository, the pipeline with rolling update will be executed automatically. It's an example of how to deploy changes automatically when e.g demo application in this case is changed.**  

### Kubectl useful commands:  
Switch Kubernetes namespace: `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=demo-namespace` (Replace `demo-namespace` with your namespace, set in environment variables above)  
Switch Kubernetes context: `kubectl config use-context cluster-test` (Replace `demo-namespace` with your context)
Check Kubernetes deployments: `kubectl get deployment`  
Check Kubernetes pods: `kubectl get pods`  
Check Kubernetes pods from all namespaces: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
Check Kubernetes services: `kubectl get services`  
Describe a resource: `kubectl describe deployment mongodb`  
Check pod logs: `kubectl get logs mongodb-7c9986b5c-26bdv -f` (Replace with your pod name)  
Check YAML of a resource: `kubectl get deployment mongodb -o yaml`  
Delete a resource: `kubectl delete deployment demo` (If another resource is depending on this resource, deletion may not work)  

### Test demo application:  
Get external IP: `kubectl get services`, service: `nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller`  
Test endpoint: `curl 'http://1.2.3.4` (replace IP with your one)  
Get users endpoint: `curl 'http://1.2.3.4/user'` (replace IP with your one)  
Create users endpoint: `curl -X POST 'http://1.2.3.4/user?username=test'` (replace IP with your one) 

### Pulumi useful commands:  
Cancel ongoing Pulumi process: `pulumi cancel`  
**In case of any errors with corrupted Pulumi state**: `pulumi cancel`, `pulumi stack export | pulumi stack import`, and `pulumi refresh`
